Description: Superfarmer is a classic boardgame invented by a polish
             mathematician Karol Borsuk. The goal of the game is to collect all
             avialable farm animals. The the winner is the first player to do
             this. This package is created for learning purpose for "Programowanie
             w R i wizualizacja danych" classes at the University of Warsaw and it
             implemets a simplified version of Superfarmer, where there is only
             one player. Apart from the game itself we implement different strategies
             to find one that leads to the shortest playing time.
